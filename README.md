# Bipolar Disorder Clinical Monitoring – Ethical Prototype

This repository contains a **frontend-only clinical prototype** designed to explore **ethical, patient-centered digital monitoring** for Bipolar Disorder within **UK healthcare principles**.

⚠️ **Important notice:**
This is a **research and design prototype**.
It is **not** a live clinical system, **not** an NHS service, and **not** intended for real-world medical use.

---

## Purpose of This Project

Digital mental health tools often fail not because of missing technology, but because of **poor ethical boundaries**.

This project explores a different approach:

* Supporting clinicians **without replacing them**
* Empowering patients **without over-surveillance**
* Designing for safety, dignity, and clarity **before automation**

The prototype focuses on **structure, flow, and responsibility**, not diagnosis or prediction.

---

## What This Prototype Demonstrates

* A **clear separation** between patient and clinician experiences
* Patient self-reporting through structured, non-diagnostic questions
* A clinician-facing view intended for **contextual awareness**, not decision-making
* Explicit avoidance of automated diagnosis, scoring, or risk labeling

This system intentionally stops **before** clinical decision-making begins.

---

## What This Prototype Does NOT Do

To avoid ethical and clinical harm, this project deliberately does **not**:

* Diagnose Bipolar Disorder
* Predict mood episodes
* Replace clinical judgment
* Process real patient data
* Claim clinical accuracy or medical validation

These omissions are **intentional design choices**, not limitations.

---

## Ethical & Regulatory Positioning

This prototype is informed by widely accepted UK healthcare and data protection principles, including:

* Patient autonomy and informed participation
* Data minimization and transparency (GDPR-aligned thinking)
* Clinical safety awareness (e.g. NHS DCB0129 principles as reference, not certification)

No clinical claims are made.
No regulatory approval is implied.

---

## Why This Is a First-of-Its-Kind Mindset Project

This project is not innovative because of advanced technology.

It is innovative because of **intentional restraint**.

In an era where mental health tools often:

* Over-automate
* Over-diagnose
* Over-promise

This prototype deliberately chooses to:

* Stop before diagnosis
* Support without replacing clinicians
* Respect uncertainty instead of hiding it

The novelty lies in **design judgment**, not feature volume.

---

## Intended Audience

This repository is intended for:

* Healthcare technology reviewers
* Clinical designers and researchers
* Ethics-focused health innovation discussions
* Early-stage healthtech exploration

It is **not** intended for patient use or deployment.

---

## Technical Scope

* Frontend-only prototype
* No backend, database, or live data
* Static demonstration of flow and structure
* Designed for conceptual review, not production

---

## Limitations & Future Considerations

Any real-world deployment would require:

* Clinical trials and ethics approval
* Regulatory clearance (e.g. MHRA where applicable)
* Secure backend infrastructure
* Multidisciplinary clinical oversight

These steps are **outside the scope** of this prototype.

## License & Disclaimer

No medical advice is provided.
Use of this prototype is at the viewer’s discretion.

## Author’s Note

This project represents an exploration of **responsible digital health design**, created with particular care for the sensitivity of mental health contexts.

Sometimes, knowing **what not to build yet** is as important as knowing what to build.
